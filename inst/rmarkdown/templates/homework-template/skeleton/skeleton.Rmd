## Problem ?.?

An example with a couple of plots.  Notice that they appear after all
of the code and are small enough to fit side-by-side.

```{r}
gf_dhistogram( ~ age, data = mosaicData::HELPrct)
gf_density( ~ age, data = mosaicData::HELPrct)
```

Here's a wider plot using `fig.width = 6`:

```{r, fig.width = 6}
gf_dhistogram( ~ age, data = mosaicData::HELPrct, binwidth = 1) %>%
  gf_dens()
```
